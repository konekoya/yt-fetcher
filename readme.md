# Youtube comments fetcher

## What is this?

A simple script to retrieve all comments from a particular YouTube video.

## Why?

From time to time, I find myself needing to find a specific comment on a YouTube video. But YouTube UI doesn't allow you to load all comments at once making finding specific comments a difficult task. With this simple script, I can retrieve all comments using just one command and quickly scan through them to locate the specific comment I need.
